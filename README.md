## How to Play

1. **Setup Ships**: 
   - Rotate and move your ships onto the game grid before the match starts. 
   - Ships can be rotated and must fit within the grid.

2. **Start the Game**: 
   - Once both players have set up their fleets, the game will begin.
   - Players take turns selecting grid squares where they think the opponent's ships are located.

3. **Hit or Miss**:
   - If a player selects a square where an enemy ship is located, it’s a "hit".
   - Otherwise, it’s a "miss".

4. **Victory**: 
   - The game ends when all of one player's ships have been sunk. The player who still has ships remaining wins.
